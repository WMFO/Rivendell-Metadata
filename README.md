Rivendell Metadata Website
==========================
WMFO - Tufts Freeform Radio  
ops@wmfo.org  
For copyrights and licensing, see COPYING.  

A simple website that allows anyone to browse tracks in a
[Rivendell](http://www.rivendellaudio.org/) library. See a working example at 
[rivendell.wmfo.org](http://rivendell.wmfo.org/).

Requires a local copy of [Twitter
Bootstap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and `credentials.php`, which
defines `$dbuser` and `$dbpass` for a SQL user with access to the Rivendell
database. It is recommended you use an account with read-only access and no
access to other databases.

WMFO is open to collaborating with the Rivendell community on this project.
